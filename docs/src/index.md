## Overview

### What


GalerkinToolkit is a high-performance finite element (FE) toolbox fully implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). It provides modular building blocks to easily implement custom finite element codes to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), using a variety of numerical schemes, and across diverse computing environments.  GalerkinToolkit integrates seamlessly with the broader Julia ecosystem. It supports external solvers such as [`PartitionedSolvers.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PartitionedArrays.jl), [`PetscCall.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PetscCall.jl), [`LinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl), [`NonLinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl), and [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) to handle the algebraic systems resulting from PDE discretizations. For visualization, the toolkit provides plotting recipes for [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) and utilities for exporting results in [`VTK` format](https://vtk.org/) using [`WriteVTK.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaVTK/WriteVTK.jl).

### Why

GalerkinToolkit is definitively not the first FEM software project out there, but it has some unique features. This includes an unified API with high- and low-level abstractions, a deep integration with the Julia package ecosystem, a new form compiler, and  a redesign of the core ideas behind [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl).

Find more information about GalerkinToolkit's features and novelties in the [Introduction](@ref) of the manual.

## How to start

 In the [Manual](@ref), you will find explanations about the software design and guides for users and developers.  Look into the [Examples](@ref) section for an overview of how to solve different types of PDEs with GalerkinToolkit. Learn how to use the library (and the basics of FEM) with the tutorials in the [Tutorials](@ref) section.

### Pre-requisites

You need to be fluent in Julia before using GalerkinToolkit. You can learn Julia using the learning materials in [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/) or the lecture notes in [https://www.francescverdugo.com/XM_40017/dev/](https://www.francescverdugo.com/XM_40017/dev/).

It is also required to be familiar with the basics of FE methods. The basics are explained in the [Tutorials](@ref) section. For more in depth introduction, you can use the following books:
  - C. Johnson [Johnson2009](@cite)
  - J. Whiteley [Whiteley2017](@cite)
  - S.C. Brenner and L. R. Scott [Brenner2007](@cite)
