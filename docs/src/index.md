- **[Manual](@ref)** -- The user and developer guide. It gives the detailed explanations on how to use and extend the library.
- **[Examples](@ref)** -- They provide a quick overview of the main functionality of the library.
- **[Tutorials](@ref)** -- Learning material to get familiar with the building blocks of the library and the basics of the FEM. They are useful even if you are FEM expert as they walk you through the library step by step.

## Overview

### What

GalerkinToolkit is a high-performance finite element toolbox implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
It provides the building blocks for users to easily implement their own finite element computer codes to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
GalerkinToolkit is fully implemented in Julia and inter operates with the Julia package ecosystem. It makes straight-forward to use external solvers from [`PartitionedSolvers.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PartitionedArrays.jl), [`PetscCall.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PetscCall.jl), [`LinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl), [`NonLinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl), and [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) to solve the algebraic systems you get after discretizing a PDE. For visualization, it defines recipes for [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) and defines helper functions to save results with [`WriteVTK.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaVTK/WriteVTK.jl) in [`vtk` format](https://vtk.org/).

### Why

GalerkinToolkit is definitively not the first FEM software project out there, but it has some unique design features.
It combines the vision of frameworks like [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and libraries like [Deal-ii](https://www.dealii.org/)
in a single package and accessible in a single programming language. Like FEniCS, it provides a high-level API close to the math notation and
a compiler of variational forms that automatically generates the finite element assembly loops. Like Deal-ii, it provides a highly customizable
low-level API allowing users to implement assembly loops by hand. Unlike any other package, it provides the building blocks to implement custom
 source-to-source compilers to generate code for numerical schemes working on computational grids.
