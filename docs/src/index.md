## Overview

### What

GalerkinToolkit is a high-performance finite element toolbox implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
It provides the building blocks for users to easily implement their own finite element computer codes to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
GalerkinToolkit is fully implemented in Julia and inter operates with the Julia package ecosystem. It makes straight-forward to use external solvers from [`PartitionedSolvers.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PartitionedArrays.jl), [`PetscCall.jl`](https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PetscCall.jl), [`LinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl), [`NonLinearSolve.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl), and [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) to solve the algebraic systems you get after discretizing a PDE. For visualization, it defines recipes for [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) and defines helper functions to save results with [`WriteVTK.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaVTK/WriteVTK.jl) in [`vtk` format](https://vtk.org/).

### Why

GalerkinToolkit is definitively not the first FEM software project out there, but it has some unique design features.
It combines the vision of frameworks like [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and libraries like [Deal-ii](https://www.dealii.org/)
in a single package and accessible in a single programming language. Like FEniCS, it provides a high-level API close to the math notation and
a compiler of variational forms that automatically generates the finite element assembly loops. Like Deal-ii, it provides a highly customizable
low-level API allowing users to implement assembly loops by hand. Unlike any other package, it provides the building blocks to implement custom
 source-to-source compilers to generate code for numerical schemes working on computational grids.



## How to start

Look into the [Examples](@ref) section for an overview of how to solve different types of PDEs with GalerkinToolkit. Learn how to use the library (and the basics of FEM) with the tutorials in the [Tutorials](@ref) section. In the [Manual](@ref) section you will find explanations about the software design and guides for users and developers.

You need to be fluent in Julia before using GalerkinToolkit. You can learn Julia using the learning materials in [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/) or the lecture notes in [https://www.francescverdugo.com/XM_40017/dev/](https://www.francescverdugo.com/XM_40017/dev/).


## Help and discussion
