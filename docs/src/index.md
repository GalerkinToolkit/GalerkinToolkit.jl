# GalerkinToolkit

## What

This package aims at providing a fully-fledged finite-element toolbox in pure Julia, with support for different computing systems from laptops to supercomputers and GPUs.  

NB. This package is work in progress; a proof-of-concept API is already available (for CPUs). The package is not production ready at this point. Planned performance and documentation improvements are needed.

## Why

This package follows a new approach to implement finite-element methods based on the lessons learned in the [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) project.
